# glacier
automata derived signal composer tool

builds and dissects compositions of real valued signals 

# what
signals with weird properties like being differentiable nowhere and complex curve geometries can be defined in terms of automata relations like rewrite rules, recursive relations, or state machines and their group-theoretic counterpart frameworks. the automata rules can be written with partial evaluators, (see github.com/drea8/cl-refal documents for more on this subject), so than function construction can be defined in terms of evaluation strategies

# why
* building non-differentiable functions or relation spaces
* recurrence relation analysis
* targets for digital and analog design
* material design stuff maybe

# to do
* window function on canvas
* signal compos js applet
